Version 0.2 (Nov 2017)
----------------------

Improved file uploading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Instead of uploading files one-by-one, first the hub is rendered to a local
"staging" directory and tracks are symlinked over to this directory. BAM and
VCF indexes are also symlinked if needed, and any HTML documentation is also
rendered to the staging directory.  This allows for inspecting the hub locally
before uploading.  The entire directory can then be uploaded with ``rsync``
using the ``-L`` option to follow symlinks.

    Diagram illustrating the changes in uploading strategies.

    *Using the old method, the hub, genomes, and trackdb files were rendered in
    the working directory, cluttering it. Each file was then individually
    rsynced to the host. In contrast, the new method first symlinks source
    files to a staging directory, and the hub, genomes, and trackdb files are
    rendered directly in that staging directory. The entire directory is then
    rsynced with a single call.*

`local_fn` argument is now replaced by `source`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To better align the semantics of keyword arguments with this new uploading
strategy, `local_fn` and `remote_fn` are deprecated as arguments to
:class:`Track` objects. With the new uploading strategy described aboved,
`local_fn` becomes confusing because there are two "local" filenames -- the
original source file as well as the symlink created to that source file in the
staging directory. Using `local_fn` and `remote_fn` is still supported, but
a DeprecationWarning will be raised and support may eventually be removed in
future releases.

Instead, use `source` to point to an existing source file (bigWig, bigBed, etc)
on disk. Sensible defaults are used for the symlink, but if you need more
control over the symlink filename (and, by extension, the filename on the
remote host), you can use the `filename` argument.

Another advantage of using `source` is that it allows better support for remote
tracks that are not uploaded as part of the hub but are stored elsewhere (e.g.,
external tracks from ENCODE can be incorporated into a hub in this manner). Use
the `url` argument instead of `source` for incorporating such tracks.

Please see the documentation for :class:`trackhub.BaseTrack` for details on
`source`, `filename`, and `url`.

Improved documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The documentation at https://daler.github.io/trackhub has been rewritten, and
now includes example code for progressively more complex trackhubs that
demonstrate different features of the package and track hubs in general.

For example:

- :ref:`quickstart`
- :ref:`grouping-example`
- :ref:`htmldoc-example`
- :ref:`assembly-example`

Each one of these is automatically run and uploaded to the `trackhub-demo
GitHub repository <https://github.com/daler/trackhub-demo>`_, and the hubs can
then be loaded in the UCSC Genome Browser from that repo. For example, the
quickstart hub can be loaded by pasting this URL into the "My Hubs" section of
the Genome Browser::

    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daler/trackhub-demo/master/quickstart/quickstart.hub.txt

Or the hub can be loaded directly into UCSC with the following URL: http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=hg38&hubUrl=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daler/trackhub-demo/master/quickstart/quickstart.hub.txt&position=chr1%3A1-5000


Version 0.1.3 (Nov 2015)
------------------------
