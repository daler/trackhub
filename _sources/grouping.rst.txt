Organizing larger track hubs
============================
This is a modified version of the example in the README which shows how to
organize the data into multiple kinds of containers -- multiWig,
compositeTracks, and superTracks. See UCSC's `grouping quick start
<https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/hubQuickStartGroups.html>`_ for some
background.

* `load the grouping example on UCSC <http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=hg38&hubUrl=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daler/trackhub-demo/master/example_grouping_hub/grouping.hub.txt&position=chr1%3A1-5000>`_
* `files in GitHub <https://github.com/daler/trackhub-demo/tree/master/example_grouping_hub>`_

    # Subgroups provide a way of tagging tracks. If you give the same tag to
    # a bigwig and a bigbed, you can use that tag to select them both. This is
    # useful for, e.g., ChIP-seq tracks where the tag is "sample" or
    # "antibody", and you can select both the signal and the called peaks at
    # the same time.
