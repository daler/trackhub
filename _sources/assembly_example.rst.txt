Assembly example
----------------
The following example shows how to generate an `Assembly Hub
<http://genomewiki.ucsc.edu/index.php/Assembly_Hubs>`_, which is a way of
supporting an assembly that is not already supported on UCSC.


It requires a ``.2bit`` file, which is created from a FASTA file using UCSC's
``faToTwoBit`` tool. If you have `bioconda <https://bioconda.github.io>`_ set
up, you can get this with ``conda install ucsc-fatotwobit``, or download it
from http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/.

This code is automatically run and the built trackhub is uploaded to the
`trackhub-demo <https://github.com/daler/trackhub-demo>`_ repository. You can
view the live hub using this link:

    # We can now add the "group" parameter to all the children of the trackDb
    for track in trackdb.children:
        track.add_params(group="example_tracks")

    trackhub.upload.upload_hub(hub=hub, host='localhost',
        remote_dir='example_assembly_hub')
