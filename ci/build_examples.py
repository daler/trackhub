"""
This script expects a single `.. code-block:: python` directive which appears
as a "literal_block" to the docutils parser. This block is then executed just
like a doctest.

It's much easier to write and debug from ReST when syntax highlighting is
working. Currently it's working with `.. code-block:: python` but not with `..
testcode::`. Furthermore, I'd like to have the README tested, but the GitHub
ReST renderer doesn't support `.. testcode::` directive and so we're stuck with
``..  code-block:: python``.
